# APCS-S1-Portfolio
This is where I am storing my python projects from Sem1. 

-- Project #1 : Food Generator Game (foodcodegame.py)
This program is a generator game, where a user will answer various questions and be given a suggested food to eat based on their answers. 
#Key Takeaways:
This project taught me more about Nested IF statements, and I was able to successfully create a project using them. 

--Project #2 : Madlibs (madlibs.py)
This program is a madlib generator, a fun and interactive game where a user will input various nouns, adjectives, etc. and recieve a silly sentence. 
#Key Takeaways: 
Throughout this project, I learned more about string concatenation and inputs, along with parameters.

--Project #3 : Multiplication Quiz (multiplicationquizproject.py)
This program is a quiz a student might use to study for a multiplication math test. A user can select their difficulty, then how many questions they would like to answer. When finished, they recieve their score. The user can 
also choose "Endless Mode" (loop), where they are able to practice until they would like to stop. 
#Key Takeaways: 
In this project, I utilized global variables, "while" loops, string concatenations, and more. This project has many intricate components, and I was able to run them smoothly together. 

--Project #4 : Pokemon App (pokemonapp.py)
This program is a "Pokemon" game, a simulator where a user is tasked with training a Charmander. They can choose to train, participate in gym battles, or rest and display the Pokemon's info along with it's picture. The goal is 
to evolve the Charmander up to a Charizard through leveling up, and keep it happy. 
#Key Takeaways:
This project taught me more about global variables, string concatenations, "if" statements, "while" loops, and more. It was a challenge to create, but I was able to succeed and create code that worked well. 

--Project #5 : Rock, Paper, Scissors (rockpaperscissors.py)
This program is a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The user will input a move, and the computer will randomize one as well, displaying who won. Wins, losses, and ties are tallied with each round, and the player can quit whenever. 
#Key Takeaways:
In this project, I used "if" statements and string concatenations, and learned more about utoilizing global variables, "while" loops, and more. I was able to understand the randomizing mechanics to ensure the game went smoothly.
